Note: Age of Colonization is the working name, it will be changed in the first full release.


##What is this?##
Age of Colonization is a game started by 1egoman and is now maintained and developed by Dimondheart.


###What kind of game is Age of Colonization?###
Age of Colonization is still in very early development, so the overall picture of the game is not yet clear. 
The final game, for comparison, will probably be something like a combination of Age of Empires and Minecraft.

###What is this branch for?###
This branch is for some experimental things that I want to mss about with. It will be mostly rewritten and overall different.
